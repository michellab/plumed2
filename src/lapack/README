/**
\defgroup internal-lapack Internal LAPACK

Internal implementation of LAPACK, imported from GROMACS.

The module in src/lapack contains an internal implementation
of LAPACK routines which is automatically imported from GROMACS
using the src/lapack/import.sh script. This set of routines
is compiled when __PLUMED_HAS_NTERNAL_LAPACK is defined
and allow PLUMED to be used when installed LAPACK libraries
are not available. Notice that the import script
creates a lapack.h file with function declarations which
are used also when installed lapack are employed. This is
done because there are lapack installation written in FORTRAN
that do not provide header files.

Since files are automatically generated, do not edit them directly.
In case you need PLUMED specific modifications
please do it by modifying the import script.

Within the PLUMED doxygen (this page) the available
macros are listed but not documented. Have a look
at the corresponding documentation at http://www.netlib.org/lapack
